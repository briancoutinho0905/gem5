""" Statistical Sampling Library Example:

        This script gives an example of using the sampling library
    for a multi-threaded application. It runs in full system mode
    and could virtually support any multi-threaded application suite.

    -------------
    Background:

    The idea behind statistical sampling is to estimate the
    performance of a system by simulating small portions of the
    application in detail (sample points). The results can then be
    condensed to give a statistically bound estimate.
    For a mulit-threaded program it is not sufficient to simulate
    a sample only once because minute timing differences could lead
    to different execution paths and a large performance difference.
    Instead, we simulate the same sample multiple times with
    small random pertubations to cover most possible interleavings.

    -------------
    Working:

    Internally, the sampling library first selects a set of random
    sample points from the ROI of the application. A sample point
    is defined by an instruction count i.e. total instructions
    executed untill the start of the sample. It then fast-forwards
    to each sample point, warms up the caches and does multiple
    simulations at that point. It continues this process till the
    last sample is simulated.

    The actual process of sampling is abstracted by the sampleROI()
    function used here. Other example scripts in this dirctory
    use basic functions that allow more fine grained control

    -------------
    Usage:

    This script takes three arguments-
        1. The total number of instructions in the ROI
            (which you can find by using runkvm.py)
        2. The number of sample points you want to take in the ROI
        3. The number of runs i.e simulations at each sample point

    -------------
    Output:

    This script's output is a set of sub-directories, one per
    sample point, named by the instructioni count for the sample point.
    Each sample directory is further sub-divided into one directory
    for each simulation at this point. These are named numerically
    by the simulation number such as 0/, 1/, 2/

    For example, with 4 samples and 5 runs the output could look like
    |
    --49349553615/  --371088644479/  --192271861574/  --1049777390582/
      |- 0/           |- 0/            |- 0/            |- 0/
      |- 1/           |- 1/            |- 1/            |- 1/
      |- 2/           |- 2/            |- 2/            |- 2/
      |- 3/           |- 3/            |- 3/            |- 3/
      |- 4/           |- 4/            |- 4/            |- 4/

#        such a random delay injected in memory acceses
