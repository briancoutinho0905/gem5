""" This script is an example of multi-threaded statistical sampling
    where we simulate a sample multiple times to cover several possible
    thread interleavings. Random pertubations are added during the
    simulation to exercise mutliple execution paths/interleavings.

    The sampling process thus works as two nested for-loops,
    the outer one for each sample point in the program and
    the inner one for mulitple observations at each sample point.

    This script takes three arguments, the total number of instructions in the
    ROI (which you can find by using runkvm.py), the number of sample
    points you want to take during the execution, and the number of runs
    to make at each sample point.

    The output is a set of two levels of directories in the outdir.
    At the top level is directory for each sample point which in turn
    contains multiple sub-directories for each random observation.
